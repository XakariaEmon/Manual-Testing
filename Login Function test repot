🧾 Login Functionality Test Report
✅ Overview
This report outlines the testing methodology and objectives for verifying the login functionality of a web application. The goal was to ensure that the login process is secure, user-friendly, and functionally correct across various conditions. The test cases cover a broad range of scenarios including functional validation, UI compliance, negative testing, and security validation (e.g., input sanitization against SQL Injection and XSS).

🔍 Objectives
Validate the core functionality of the login form.

Ensure security vulnerabilities are mitigated (e.g., XSS, SQLi).

Check input field validations and error handling.

Confirm the login UI behaves responsively across screen sizes.

Ensure appropriate feedback is provided to the user.

## 🧪 Test Types Covered

| Type             | Description                                                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Functional       | Tests successful and unsuccessful login attempts.                          |
| Negative         | Tests invalid inputs such as blank fields, wrong credentials, etc.         |
| UI & UX          | Ensures the interface is aligned, fields are labeled, and button actions.  |
| Security         | Checks against common attacks like SQL Injection, XSS.                     |
| Validation       | Confirms correct error messages appear for invalid inputs.                 |
| Responsive       | Ensures layout and usability on different devices.                         |
| Performance      | Measures login response time under various conditions.                     |

## 🔒 Security Test Methodology

1. **Input Validation**  
   - Verified that both email/username and password fields reject malformed or dangerous inputs.

2. **SQL Injection Attempt**  
   - Input: `' OR 1=1 --`  
   - Goal: Ensure the system uses parameterized queries and is not vulnerable.

3. **XSS Injection Test**  
   - Input: `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`  
   - Goal: Check whether user input is properly sanitized before rendering.

4. **Brute Force Resilience**  
   - Simulated rapid invalid login attempts to test account lockout or CAPTCHA mechanisms.

5. **Error Message Clarity**  
   - Ensured generic error messages like *"Invalid credentials"* are used to avoid exposing which field is incorrect.

6. **Session Handling**  
   - Confirmed secure session tokens are created on login with proper expiration and logout behavior.
